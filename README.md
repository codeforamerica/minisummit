Planning for BETA
=========

Let's plan for BETA! Please put collateral/design work/etc. in this repo.

#### Uploading design work

`designs` is for print/web design work. Please make a new folder for your work and upload the following

* Original files (.ai for Illustrator, .indd for InDesign. .psd for Photoshop)
* A web-ready or print-ready export (.jpg, .png, etc.)
* Any dependencies for your original file (artwork, typefaces)

#### BETA landing page

* Check out the `gh-pages` branch to work on the BETA website

#### Tasks going forward

See the Issues. Feel free to assign an event to yourself. ddsdsdsds
