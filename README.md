Planning for Mini Summit
=========

Let's plan for the mini summit! Please put collateral/design work/etc. in this repo.

#### Uploading design work

`designs` is for print/web design work. Please make a new folder for your work and upload the following

* Original files (.ai for Illustrator, .indd for InDesign. .psd for Photoshop)
* A web-ready or print-ready export (.jpg, .png, etc.)
* Any dependencies for your original file (artwork, typefaces)

#### Mini-summit landing page

* Check out the `gh-pages` branch to work on the minisummit website

#### Tasks going forward

See the Issues. Feel free to assign an event to yourself.
